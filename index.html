        <h1><u>Salmon Toast</u></h1>
        <body>
            <p>Mom, when I was little I remember sitting at our dining table eating salmon all mixed into buttery, salty rice on those black and green marbled plates.
             I also remember running up and down the house, finding little warm nooks, tucking away bread to rise, punching it, and baking it.</p>
             <p>I made this recently and it reminded me of you. It is nourishing and rich and fun, and there are a million ways you could dress it up.</p>
             <p>I love you so much, and could not be more grateful to have you as my mother. Happy birthday!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp Sourdough starter</li>
            <li>150g whole wheat flour + 150g water</li>
            <li>250g water + 1 tsp active dry yeast + 350g bread flour + 12g salt</li>
            <li>1 piece nice salmon, good peppercorns, a lemon, and olive oil.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix sourdough, whole wheat and water. Let sit at least 1 day. 
                You might mix this on Monday night and begin making the bread on Wednesday morning for dinner that night.</li>
            <li>Mix the preferment, water, bread flour, yeast, and salt.</li>
            <li>Fold 3-5 times over the next hour.</li>
            <li>An hour before you want to eat, or whenever is convenient, shape the dough into a log and put it in a loaf pan. You don't have to shape it if you don't feel like it.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 475F and get the salmon out.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the crust is dark, burnished gold.</li>
            <li>Put the salmon into a cold skillet. Drizzle around the salmon with olive oil. Cover liberally with salt and heavily with pepper. Lots of pepper. It is a star of this show.</li>
            <li>Ensure you have lots of ground pepper in the oil to fry.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat to medium low and let the salmon cook until the skin is crispy and the fish is rare.
                 Halfway through, squeeze a lemon over the fish and put it into the pan too. I let it rest on top of the fish.</li>
            <li>When the bread is done, without feeling any need to let it rest, cut thick slices, roughly one inch.</li>
            <li>Cut a steak of salmon to fit over the top of the bread. Shmear it down to cover the bread entirely. Spoon over the lemon pepper pan sauce. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
